# Sussar

A game based on Pulsar(Sega, 1981) made with Assembly Risc V.
To run it you will need [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).

- Open "game.asm" file
- On rars meu, choose tools and open "bitmap display" and "keyboard and mmio simulator"
- connect both to program
- enjoy it

A better explanation of how we made it can be found on this [document](https://github.com/MaxwellOliveira01/pulsar-assembly/blob/main/Relatorio_Sussar_ISC.pdf) (wrote in portuguese)
